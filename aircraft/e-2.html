                by Grumman, upadated variants are still in frontline service to this day.
                The primary variants used the the Navy have been the E-2A/B/C/D, with the E-2D being the variant currently in use today.

                command and control, surveillance of land and sea, control of air defense,
                or strike aircraft during offensive operations, and controlling search and rescue operations as its core abilities.
