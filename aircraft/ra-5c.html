        The RA-5C Vigilante was initially designed in 1954, making its debut in the fleet in 1961 as the A-5. The A-5 was designed as a
        high altitude, high speed nuclear bomber. But when the Navy relinquished that role (from dedicated bombers) the aircraft found a
        new role as an advanced Reconnaissance platform. Being the first aircraft to introduce a "Heads Up Display" (HUD) and boasting a
        wide array of new electronic surveillance/gathering equimpment. It was one of the largest aircraft to operate off of aircraft carriers,
        being known as difficult to bring back aboard "the boat". It served in Vietnam in the Reconnaissance role admirably, while having
        the highest loss rate (per production run) of any aircraft of the conflict in part due to accidents. It was retired from the service
        in 1979.
