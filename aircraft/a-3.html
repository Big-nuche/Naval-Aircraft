        <p>The A-3 SkyWarrior (otherwise known semi-affectionately as "the whale") was initially designed as a heavy nuclear bomber in 1952/3.
             Although advances in surface to air missile technology as well as advancements in engine output(in the supersonic age) begin rendering its initial designed role obsolete.
             The type soon took on other important roles, namely tanking, electronic jamming and electronic intelligence gathering. Serving all the way until 1991 in reduced numbers.
             It was routinely (and statistically) one of the largest aircraft to operate off of aircraft carriers, serving in the Vietnam War, and throughout the cold war ending in limited duties
             during Operation Desert Storm. Notable variants include the A-3, EA-3, RA-3, and RK/KA-3.
